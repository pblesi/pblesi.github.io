I created a set of Wifi touch lights, heavily based on John Harrison's Filimin touch lights. The lights change color when touched and synchronize their color with their counterpart lights anywhere in the globe. Full details can be found in my [blog post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-12-28-wifi-touch-light %}).
