<p>
Hi, I'm Patrick Blesi. I'm a developer/engineering manager who works at [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/), a payments processing company and subsidiary of [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/us/home).
I'm a former [teacher](https://www.teachforamerica.org/), current husband, and puppy parent. I live in [Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago), learned things at
[Wisconsin](http://www.wisc.edu/), and grew up in [Minnesota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Prairie,_Minnesota).
</p>

<p>
I'm passionate about anything that has to do with honing a craft, whether it's software development, cooking, or personal and professional improvement. I'm relentless in my pursuit of perfection (though oddly not a perfectionist). Some day I aspire to be an avid wood worker and learn to play the piano.
